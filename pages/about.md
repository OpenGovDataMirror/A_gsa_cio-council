Originally established by Executive Order 13011 (Federal Information Technology) and later codified by the E-Government Act of 2002, the CIO Council is the principal interagency forum for improving agency practices related to the design, acquisition, development, modernization, use, sharing, and performance of Federal information resources.

The CIO Council is one element of an interagency support structure established to achieve information resource management objectives delineated in legislation including the E-Government Act of 2002, Government Paperwork Elimination Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, Government Performance and Results Act, and the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996.
