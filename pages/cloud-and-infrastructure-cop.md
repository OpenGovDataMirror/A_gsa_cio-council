The Cloud & Infrastructure Community of Practice (C&I CoP) provides both in-person and virtual forums for agencies to share and learn about Federal IT infrastructure. Discussion topics include cloud adoption, new technologies, best practices, common challenges, and more. The C&I CoP facilitates information sharing among federal agencies to speed cloud migration and data center consolidation.

## How to participate in the C&I CoP
#### Attend Monthly C&I CoP Meetings
**The C&I CoP meets the first Wednesday afternoon of each month, at GSA in Washington, DC.** These meetings provide agencies with an opportunity to ask questions and share insights with IT infrastructure colleagues. Participants can attend either in-person or virtually. Email [dcoi@gsa.gov](mailto:dcoi@gsa.gov) to submit agenda items or suggest topics for future meetings.

#### Participating in Working Groups
C&I CoP members can join working groups to participate in in-depth discussions and research on federal IT. Working group members collaboratively develop solutions such as white papers,and share with the wider C&I CoP for consideration. Email [dcoi@gsa.gov](mailto:dcoi@gsa.gov) to learn more about joining these working groups.

#### View Online Resources
**Visit the [C&I CoP Homepage](https://community.max.gov/display/Egov/CIO+Council+Data+Center+Optimization+Initiative+Community+of+Practice)**  
The C&I CoP’s MAX.gov page is the main online repository of CoP information. Find past presentations, upcoming meeting information, and other CoP-specific resources. Anyone with a federal email address can sign up and access the C&I CoP CIO Council MAX page.

**Find C&I CoP resources on the [CIO Council Knowledge Portal](https://community.max.gov/x/8YwyK )**  
The DCOI PMO, a co-sponsor of the CoP, has produced resources ranging from guidance on cooling for data centers, to steps agencies should consider when migrating to the cloud. These resources are stored on the CIO Council Knowledge Portal on OMB MAX. Anyone with a federal email address can sign up and access these documents on MAX.

Email [dcoi@gsa.gov](mailto:dcoi@gsa.gov) to contribute to or suggest resources for the Knowledge Portal.

**Review the [Application Rationalization Playbook](https://www.cio.gov/assets/files/Application-Rationalization-Playbook.pdf)**  
The Playbook is a practical guide for application rationalization and IT portfolio management under Cloud Smart. It helps Portfolio Managers think through their agency’s approach to IT modernization. It also addresses challenges and opportunities for IT leaders, managers, and technical practitioners, and offers suggestions on how to overcome barriers to success. Each agency should tailor it to fit their unique needs. Application rationalization will ultimately help federal agencies mature IT portfolio management capabilities, empower leaders to make informed decisions, and improve the delivery of key mission and business services.
