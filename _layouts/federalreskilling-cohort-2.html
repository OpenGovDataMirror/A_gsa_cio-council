Please work with your supervisor to ensure that you can fulfill the Academy requirements.

            <h4 class="rs-heading">When will I hear about my application status?</h4>

            <br><br><br>
            <h4 class="rs-heading">Am I guaranteed a cybersecurity position upon completion of the program?</h4>
            The Council cannot guarantee that individuals who complete the Academy will be offered jobs; however, graduates will develop the necessary skills and certification to apply for cybersecurity positions at Federal agencies. The program
            team will provide coaching and guidance to graduates to complete competitive applications for these positions.
            <br><br><br>
            <h4 class="rs-heading">If I am not selected for the Academy, what can I do to improve my cybersecurity knowledge and skills?</h4>
            There are a variety of free resources available online to help build cybersecurity knowledge. Online learning platforms often offer free or low-cost content that learners can take on-demand, at their own pace. In addition, the Federal Virtual Training Environment (FedVTE), hosted by the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies, offers training for free to government personnel and veterans. <a href="https://niccs.us-cert.gov/training/federal-virtual-training-environment-fedvte">https://niccs.us-cert.gov/training/federal-virtual-training-environment-fedvte</a>
            <br><br><br>

            <h4 class="rs-heading">Will I be paid for the time off required to take the live course and will this cover any overtime pay?</h4>
           You and your supervisor should discuss the requirements for this program and ensure that you are able to fulfill the requirements. Each applicant is responsible for working with their supervisor to ensure compliance with each agencyâs policies.
            <br><br><br>
            <h4 class="rs-heading">Where will the training take place?</h4>

            This is a reskilling Academy created to develop new talent to fill open cybersecurity positions in the government. The Academy allows the government to meet the growing need for cybersecurity and IT skills by finding high-potential
            talent among employees not working in IT or cybersecurity. The next cohort later in 2019 will be open to IT professionals. Please check cio.gov for more details.
            <br><br><br>-->
