<div id="textblock_547613"><h2 class="section_header">FEDERAL CIO COUNCIL CELEBRATES NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY AWARENESS MONTH</h2></BR><br />

This October, the Federal CIO Council is proud to participate in National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM), a nationwide effort to make the Internet safer for everyone. NCSAM is an opportunity to educate and engage stakeholders in the public and private sectors and the American public on cybersecurity issues through events, communications, and outreach activities across the country.<br /></BR><br />

People are spending more time online than ever before. Americans enjoy the conveniences of their digital lives, but these benefits are not without risks. As more people take advantage of online shopping, banking, and social networks to communicate with friends and family, they also expose themselves to cyber threats and vulnerabilities that are inherent in many technologies. Cyber crime is on the rise—including identity and intellectual property theft, scams, frauds, network intrusions, and financial crimes—and it is essential that all Americans know how to protect themselves and their workplaces online.<br /></BR><br />
NCSAM is an opportunity to raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity and to equip the American public with the tools and resources they need to stay safe. The Federal CIO Council believes strongly in this mission. As a partner in the Department of Homeland Security’s Stop.Think.Connect.™ Campaign, The Federal CIO Council is committed to promoting online safety for everyone.<br /></BR><br />

During NCSAM, we urge every American to take steps to create a safer Internet for everyone. Even small actions can make a huge difference in defending from cyber threats. Here are some simple tips everyone can follow to keep themselves, their identities, and their information safe online:
 <LI>Set strong passwords that are long and complex, change them regularly, and don’t share them with anyone.</LI>
<LI>Treat your personal information like money </LI>
<LI>value it and be cautious about how apps and websites collect it from you. - Regularly update the software on your Internet-connected devices, including PCs, smartphones, and tablets, to reduce the risk of infection from malware. </LI>
<LI>Talk with your family, friends, and community about the importance of Internet safety. - Control and limit who can see your information online by checking the privacy and security settings on your accounts and apps.</LI>
 <LI>Be cautious about what you receive or read online; if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</LI><br /></BR><br />

During NCSAM 2017, the Federal CIO Council is supporting the efforts of the Department of Homeland Security to promote increased cybersecurity awareness in America. Cyberspace promises tremendous opportunities for our Nation, and we each play a part in keeping it safe. </div>
