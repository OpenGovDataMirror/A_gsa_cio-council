The <a href="http://www.itdashboard.gov/">IT Dashboard</a> was launched on June 1, 2009. Through the IT Dashboard, Federal agencies and the public have the ability to view details of Federal information technology (IT) investments online and to track their progress over time. The IT Dashboard displays public data received from agency Exhibit 53 and Exhibit 300 reports, including general information on over 7,000 Federal IT investments and detailed data for over 700 of those investments that agencies classify as “major.” Agency Chief Information Officers (CIO) are responsible for evaluating and updating select data on the IT Dashboard on a regular basis.

The IT Dashboard was created to shine light onto the performance and spending of IT investments across the Federal Government. If a project is over budget or behind schedule, the public can see by how much money and time, and can see the person responsible for the cost overrun or delay.

The IT Dashboard gives the public access to the same tools and analysis that the government uses to oversee the performance of the Federal IT investments. The transparency and analysis features of the IT Dashboard also make it harder for underperforming projects to go unnoticed, and easier for the government to focus action on the projects where it’s needed most.
