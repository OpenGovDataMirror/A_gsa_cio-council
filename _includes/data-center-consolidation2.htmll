In February 2010, the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) was created to reverse the historic growth of Federal data centers. The Initiative seeks to curb this unsustainable increase by reducing the cost of data center hardware, software, and operations; shifting IT investments to more efficient computing platforms; promoting the use of Green IT by reducing the overall energy and real estate footprint of government data centers; and increasing the IT security posture of the government.

To drive this effort, the CIO Council launched the Federal Data Center Consolidation Task Force that serves as a forum for best practices and lessons learned. It has led ongoing inventory validation and verification mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of this data and monitor the execution of agency consolidation plans. The Task Force is addressing topics such as, but not limited to, cost analysis, the government-wide marketplace detailed in the IT Reform Plan, technical approaches to consolidation, acquisition modalities, and the coordination of the Task Force with Federal real property and sustainability efforts.</p><p>By shutting down and consolidating under-performing data centers and optimizing the data centers in our Federal inventory, we stand to save taxpayers billions of dollars and curb spending on underutilized infrastructure. This means a shift from a model that risks procuring duplicative and wasteful infrastructure that utilizes only a fraction of the computing power purchased to a newer model, where that risk is reduced as the government purchases IT infrastructure as a service, deployed in a scalable and rapid fashion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
