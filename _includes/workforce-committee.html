The Workforce Committee's agenda encompasses the full employment life cycle: workforce planning,
 recruitment, retention and career development. We work with the HR community to develop, implement
 and communicate strategies to recruit, retain and manage a fully trained and qualified IT workforce,
 to meet current and future mission requirements. The Workforce Committee is committed to its strategic
 goal of providing the Federal Government with a cadre of highly capable IT professionals with mission
 critical competencies to meet agency goals.
